# My OpenGL exploration
My plan for this is to create an OpenGL application that takes in ".obj" files and renders them.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/BaleyEccles/OpenGL/assets/106227583/763d0c6b-5425-4be8-95ec-b6059211c6c8">

This is an example image of what is currently possible, it depicts a teapot being rotated, with the colours being deterimed by the normal data in the .obj file.
